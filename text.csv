1,Apr 3 2017 7:19 AM,"It doesn't resonate with me. It seems more like a travel agency ad where a travel agency is trying to persuade you to be a part of their tour until you see the airbnb at the end. Maybe if the airbnb experience was compared with a hotel experience it would be more clear.","",
2,Apr 1 2017 1:35 PM,"Yes, absolutely. Makes we want to go to all those places & do it the Airbnb way!","",
3,Mar 31 2017 4:14 PM," Yes. When traveling for work or with my family, I think it is important to be able to feel comfortable and to be able to communicate with someone who knows the area. Additionally, looking like “tourists” that go to their hotels vs. going to a home can potentially increase the changes of someone being mugged/having their possessions stolen.  ","",
4,Mar 31 2017 4:13 PM,"I use AirBnB often, so this commercial stood out to me. I feel like Airbnb is the perfect way to submerge yourself into the culture of where ever you're traveling to. ","",
5,Mar 31 2017 4:12 PM,"Generally positive about this ad, but the featured locations look boring to me. Later pleased to see the site has representation in Africa, Middle East and Asia. ","",
6,Mar 31 2017 4:11 PM," I do not travel much, so it does not fit my normal needs.  ","",
7,Mar 31 2017 2:45 PM,"The message of living there. It sends the message that you will be able to better enjoy and explore a place if you ""live"" there.","",
8,Mar 30 2017 6:29 PM,"yes. i'm not big on guided tours.","",
9,Mar 30 2017 5:33 PM,"Makes destinations feel comfortable ","",
10,Mar 30 2017 1:17 PM,"I don't know if this ""resonated"" with me as much because I've already used Airbnb and have formed my opinions about it based on my personal experiences, but I do like the idea of promoting it as a way to live somewhere rather than to simply visit and stay in a touristy hotel.","",
11,Mar 30 2017 12:44 PM,"No, I think of Airbnb as an affordable alternative to hotels. I don't use it because I want to resume my normal daily activities but because it's cheaper and I may get more space.  ","",
12,Mar 30 2017 7:59 AM,"I love this ad! Traveling can be bittersweet because of the fear of missing something or not getting an authentic experience. By 'living' in the country or place that you are visiting, the whole experience of the vacation changes, and it becomes more of an immersion than a trip. ","",
13,Mar 30 2017 7:42 AM,"Absolutely! I think staying in an Airbnb while touring a new city would definitely alter your stay in a positive way, allowing you to immerse yourself in what is really is like to be a member of the location! Staying in hotels really can make you feel like a tourist... Airbnb makes you feel right at home!","",
14,Mar 30 2017 5:02 AM,"Not so much","",
15,Mar 30 2017 4:49 AM,"That video made me want to go on a trip! I think the big thing for me in this video is that using Airbnb allows you to more fully be immersed in the culture of the place you are visiting. ","",
16,Mar 30 2017 4:45 AM,"Kind of. I like the idea of experiencing local culture rather than from the isolated perspective of a hotel. But sometimes I don't want to cook or make my bed on vacation.","",
17,Mar 30 2017 3:59 AM,"Yes it's how I like to travel","",
18,Mar 30 2017 3:36 AM,"Yes you can fall in love with a new place or learn how similar the new cultures really are. Hotels seem impersonal at times.","",
19,Mar 30 2017 3:20 AM,"It's a good advertisement but still not sure what it is","",
20,Mar 29 2017 10:14 PM,"Yes, I hate feeling like a tourist. I always want to do what the locals do.","",
21,Mar 29 2017 9:28 PM,"I like interacting with locals when I travel. I like the tagline of ""live there""--but I'm not sure the video helped me be aware that some Airbnb bookings have the locals still living there while I'm a guest.","",
22,Mar 29 2017 8:18 PM,"Yes- I do like the homey experience of airbnb, especially when traveling with a group because it's cheaper than multiple hotel rooms, you can all stay together, and save money on meals by cooking at the home.","",
23,Mar 29 2017 8:05 PM,"It was interesting ","",
24,Mar 29 2017 7:55 PM,"It makes you not want to be a tourist and instead really experience living in the place you are visiting. ","",
25,Mar 29 2017 7:54 PM,"Not really. To go to foreign land with young children I may want to do more research on the place I will stay put.Hotel maybe a better option for me.","",
26,Mar 29 2017 6:29 PM,"Yes. It drew me in and made me laugh, as well as had a lot of diversity both in location and people in the ad, which appeals to me and makes me think more of the company. ","",
27,Mar 29 2017 6:25 PM,"Yes! I love the idea of truly getting to experience a place, and part of an experience is feeling like you belong. This ad made you feel like you deserve to belong as a local wherever you're staying. ","",
28,Mar 29 2017 6:22 PM,"Yes,  I stayed at an AirBnB in Paris on my  honeymoon and it was a great experience! ","",
29,Mar 29 2017 6:16 PM,"Live like home while visiting somewhere that isn't home","",
30,Mar 29 2017 6:14 PM,"I like the thought of feeling and acting like a local. It's appealing to not be touristy in most locations.","",
31,Mar 29 2017 6:10 PM,"I like the idea of experiencing a place by ""living as the locals do"" however I wouldn't want to make my bed and clean up after myself ","",
32,Mar 29 2017 6:09 PM,"Yes, I am a firm believer in living in a culture as opposed to being a tourist in it. ","",
33,Mar 29 2017 5:46 PM,"Sure, all the travel sounds fun!","",
34,Mar 29 2017 5:41 PM,"No","",
35,Mar 29 2017 3:04 PM,"I like it, just not sure if I agree with ""do your routine"" in a new place. It's supposed to be different than your everyday!","",
36,Mar 29 2017 12:47 PM,"Feels like you're getting a authentic experience","",
37,Mar 29 2017 12:03 PM,"Yes, it makes travel seem comfortable and easy","",
38,Mar 29 2017 11:26 AM,"Because when I travel for vacation, I want to feel like I'm on vacation. To me, that includes some amount of being cared for (housekeeping, room service, etc.).","",
39,Mar 29 2017 11:24 AM,"No ","",
40,Mar 29 2017 11:00 AM,"Yes, this Airbnb advertisement resonates with me. I feel happiest on vacation when I am able to disconnect. Besides, traveling should be for the experience and culture - not photo or post.","",
41,Mar 29 2017 10:53 AM,"It shows you being part of the country/community you are visiting, and embracing it. Not just staying in hotels and going out to eat at restaurants, but feeling like for as long as you are visiting that location like you are living there, like it is home.","",
42,Mar 29 2017 9:52 AM,"Somewhat - I don't mind doing touristy things, and this feels like it is looking down on those activities","",
43,Mar 29 2017 8:49 AM,"Yes!  Visually stunning, nice voiceover, but most of all, the message really sings to me.  ""Don't go there, live there"" just breathes authenticity and evokes the spirit of multi-cultural beauty - we all live differently, but are so very much alike... let's share our riches together. Lovely vibe.","",
44,Mar 29 2017 8:44 AM,"Yes, we enjoy experiencing locations as a ""local"" vs a tourist. We enjoy running into ""neighbors"" and talking and learning.","",
45,Mar 29 2017 8:13 AM,"Yes, absolutely. Feeling like you're at home rather than a tourist can be comforting rather than stressful, and it also affords you more freedom as a traveler. Airbnb is also often less expensive than staying at a hotel which is a perk as well. ","",
46,Mar 28 2017 4:57 PM,"Somewhat. I like the idea of being immersed in a culture, I just want a bit more luxury. ","",
